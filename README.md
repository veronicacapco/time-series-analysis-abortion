### Abstract
This project investigates the trends in abortion rates in the United States using data from 1973 to 2016, using Seasonal ARIMA modeling (SARIMA) and Threshold Autoregressive modeling (TAR). It can be seen through the time series plots that abortion rates for women in the United States have been on a decline, and that the ACF plots show that these rates are non-stationary. This project investigates possible reasons for that decline as well as predicting future values of abortion rates. Using the statistical methods mentioned earlier, I have found that abortions rates are likely to stay on this decline for the coming years. The results from the TAR modeling using a threshold = 0.05 show that the trend is consistent with the original data. With these findings, we can use the information obtained from the analysis and graphs to determine possible sudden changes with abortion rates and look deeper into what threshold parameters can say about the future of abortion in the United States.
